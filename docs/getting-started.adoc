= Getting Started

== Installation
To build *ginger*, you will need to have https://cmake.org/[CMake]. For most
you can use your package manager, e.g. `apt-get`, `pacman` or `yum` on Linux
or `homebrew`, `macports` or `fink` on OS X.

=== Linux, OS X, and Windows (Bash, MinGW and Cygwin)
Once CMake is installed, building, testing and installing the library is a snap
[source]
----
$ cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
$ make all tests
$ sudo make install
----

=== Windows with MSVC
Building with MSVC is a bit more involved. Open the Visual C++ MSBuild command
prompt (should be in your start menu). You can then run cmake build and test
from the prompt:
[source]
----
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G"Visual Studio 14 2015"
$ msbuild /p:Configuration=Release ALL_BUILD.vcxproj
$ test\Release\ginger_unittest.exe
----
Installation requires the user to manually copy the headers and libraries to
wherever the user would like.
